Theme:
"Your days are numbered"

Small shack has surrounding candles  that go out over time. This is the only source of light for you after the sun sets. You must fend off enemies while keeping the light on.

Struggle and live. 
The dark attracts the beasts. 
The bullets put them to sleep. 
The light keeps them at bay. 
How many days can you keep it up?
